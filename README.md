# NoGUI-Basic-Keylogger
A simple and straightforward keylogger 

# Functionality:
- Tracks and stores keystrokes in a txt file
- Allows user to encrypt the file and stores the key
- Allows user to decrypt the file using the respective key

# Purpose of the Keylogger:
- Its mainly used in the cybersecurity field to track keystrokes for security or investigative purposes.

# Additional notes on the Keylogger:
- My first take on creating a real world project, I will be updating this keylogger with more functions as I develop my skills.
- Will soon work on integrating the GUI I have prepared with the code.
